<h3>1. How to Run Securiot</h3>
<p>To start using Securiot, you must first plug in the Raspberry Pi to a power source and an internet connection. Once the device is set up, you can run "python DesktopApp.py" on a laptop or run the Securiot Android application on your android device. Note there are some python libraries that the Desktop App uses such as openCV and easygui which will need to be installed. The application will provide options to turn the camera on, arm the system, take a snapshot, or turn the camera off. If you click each of the options, dialog boxes will guide you through the process. In the desktop application, make sure to press OK after reading the message box since the program halts on the message boxes, and press any key while the mouse is inside an image to exit the image and move forward. If you have any errors while running the desktop application, you can always restart the desktop application and select "Turn Camera Off / Reset System" to reset Securiot. This will clear Securiot's memory and return it to the state when it was first turned on.

<h3>2. File Index and Descriptions</h3>
<ul>
<li>144r_2.pem - PEM file needed for logging into the server to communicate.</li>
<li>common.pyc - A file with common functions needed in video.pyc</li>
<li>DesktopApp.py - The Securiot Desktop Application. Used to control the Raspberry Pi and operate Securiot.</li>
<li>info.txt - The file used to communicate back and forth with the server.</li>
<li>readme.html - This document</li>
<li>runsec.sh - Command the raspberry pi runs on startup to start Securiot.</li>
<li>securiot.py - The program running on the Raspberry Pi which runs  Securiot. This program handles all aspects of Securiot on the Pi and contains the system's algorithm.</li>
<li>server.py - A python server used on the server to communicate with the android application.</li>
<li>to_receive - Bash file which performs scp and downloads a file from the server.</li>
<li>to_receive_desktop - Bash file which is the same as to_receive except for the destination file path. (Used by DesktopApp.py)</li>
<li>to_send - Bash file which uploads files to server.</li>
<li>video.pyc - A file with common functions used by securiot.py.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Code Layout</h3>
<p>
On the Raspberry Pi, runsec.sh is run on startup which starts securiot.py. This runs indefinitely on the Pi. DesktopApp.py can be run on a laptop to control Securiot. When the Desktop app downloads the video files of an object being stolen, they are saved in before.h264 and after.h264. The other files are used by these applications.
